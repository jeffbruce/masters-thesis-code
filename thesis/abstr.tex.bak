This thesis presents results from two clinical hearing aid studies.  Wide dynamic range compression (WDRC), a standard hearing aid amplification algorithm in the industry, is compared against a novel hearing aid called the Neuro-Compensator (NC), which employs a neural-based amplification algorithm based on a computational model of the auditory periphery.

The hearing aid technologies are compared across a multitude of auditory domains.  Objective measures of speech intelligibility in quiet and in noise, music perception, sound localization, and subjective measures of sound quality are obtained.

It was hypothesized that the NC would produce more normal outcomes in many of the Domains where each hearing aid amplification algorithm
