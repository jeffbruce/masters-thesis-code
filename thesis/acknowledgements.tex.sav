\paragraph{}I thank both of my supervisors, Dr. Sue Becker and Dr. Laurel Trainor, for their unwavering support, which has been instrumental to my success.  I have grown so much in the past few years as a result of their feedback, and for that I am very grateful.  My accomplishments are also due in part to my labmates, who often provided me with helpful suggestions when I presented at lab meetings.  Thanks for making the lab a fun place to work.  I would also like to thank Dr. Larry Roberts, for his generosity in lending his lab space to me to perform hearing evaluations, thus allowing me to recruit participants for my experiments.

I must also thank the industry partner who I collaborated with during this project, VitaSound Audio Inc., for the time they spared to meet with me to provide guidance on how to properly conduct my experiments.  From VitaSound in particular, I would like to thank Gora Ganguli, Philippe Pango, Karl Wiklund, Mario Augustyniak, Sam Mok, Karen Lalonde, and Clare Daley for their assistance throughout the course of the project.  I am deeply grateful for the assistance of Peter Chmielewski, the hearing instrument specialist who I worked with throughout the study, who put in many hours programming the hearing aids for the participants in all of my experiments, as well as consulted with the participants, and provided me with a basic, practical education of hearing aids.  I could also not have done the project without help from two undergraduate assistants, Katelyn Muir, and Ranya Amir.

Last, I thank my Mom and Dad for their consistent support, encouragement, wisdom, and love, and my brothers, David, Neil, and Daniel, for paving the path.  This work was funded by NSERC 5-38048 and MITACS 5-98517.
